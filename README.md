## Contributions
We always welcome any contributors, and you can start contributing immediately if you desire. Feel free to join our Discord: #ResQSync-web to join the community, or if you need help with the below.

If you are a new developer looking to contribute something to ResQSync, please take a look and see if there's anything that you'd like to work on in the issue tracker.

The "Good First Issue" label has been added to any tasks that seem like a good way to get started working with the codebase.

If you are looking to make a lasting impact on the project from the get-go, issues with the label "Help Wanted" are tasks that we'd really like to have done but don't yet have time to do ourselves.

Please let us know that you're working on an open issue and let us assign it to you, this ensures that two people aren't working on the same issue, and ensures that all effort is valuable to the project. If an issue hasn't seen activity in a couple of weeks, feel free to ping the assignee to see if they're working on it, or ask a maintainer to reassign the issue to you.

If you can't work on an issue anymore, please post another message to let us know.

If it's unclear exactly what needs to be done, or how to do it, please don't hesitate to ask for clarification or help!

## Project Setup Guide
We use <b>Next js 13</b> to set up locally follow the below steps :

1. Run `npm install` first to install all the required libraries or dependencies for the project.
```bash
npm install
```
2. Run the project in your browser, we are running on `PORT:3000` by default.
   
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
